## Key Components

### Research Paper

The paper is organized into several sections:

- Introduction
- Methodology
- Results
- Discussion
- Conclusion

### Data Analysis

Python scripts for data analysis and insight generation:

- `add_insights.py`
- `add_comprehensive_insights.py`

### Visualizations

Key visualizations in `docs/figures/`:

- Overall Performance Analysis
- Method Comparisons
- Interaction Plots
- Detailed Experiment Reports

### Results Tables

Comprehensive analysis results in LaTeX tables covering:

- Cross-tabulation analyses (ρ, noise, magnitude, data type)
- Correlation summaries
- Basic statistical summaries

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Ensure you have LaTeX installed for paper compilation
3. Install Python dependencies (if running analysis scripts)
