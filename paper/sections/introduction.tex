\section{Introduction}

Variable selection and importance assessment in multivariate analysis present significant challenges in modern data analysis. Two prominent methods that address these challenges are Partial Least Squares-Variable Importance in Projection (PLS-VIP) \citep{wold2001pls} and Relative Weight Analysis (RWA). While both methods aim to quantify variable importance in complex datasets, their performance characteristics under different conditions remain incompletely understood \citep{chong2005performance, tonidandel2011relative}. The complete implementation and analysis code for this study is available in a public repository \citep{marinucci2024pls}.

Marketing research field requires reliable variable importance methods. Recent challenges include the comparison across two methods PLS and RWA. In marketing research, where datasets often contain a large number of customer attributes or survey responses, reliable variable importance assessments are critical for understanding consumer behavior and optimizing decision-making. This study is particularly relevant for datasets containing ordinal predictors, such as Likert-scale survey responses, where standard regression-based approaches like RWA may struggle.

This study aims to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Compare the performance of PLS-VIP and RWA across diverse analytical conditions
    \item Identify the strengths and limitations of each method
    \item Provide evidence-based guidelines for method selection
    \item Evaluate the impact of key factors on method performance
\end{itemize}

Understanding the relative performance of PLS-VIP and RWA under different conditions is crucial for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Improving the reliability of variable importance assessments
    \item Guiding method selection in applied research
    \item Advancing our understanding of method behavior in complex scenarios
    \item Supporting evidence-based methodological decisions
\end{itemize}

The following sections present our comprehensive simulation study, examining these methods across various conditions to provide practical insights for researchers and practitioners.
