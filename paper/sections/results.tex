\section{Results}

\subsection{Overall Performance}
The analysis revealed significant differences in performance between PLS-VIP and RWA methods across various conditions (F = 633.63, p < 0.001, $\eta^2$ = 0.006). While this effect size is modest, PLS-VIP consistently achieved higher accuracy scores across different experimental conditions, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:basic_performance}. The relatively small effect size for method differences ($\eta^2$ = 0.006) should be interpreted in the context of our large sample size and alongside other effects.

\subsection{Effect of Number of Predictors}
The number of predictors ($J$) emerged as the strongest predictor of performance (F = 858.53, p < 0.001, $\eta^2$ = 0.017). This larger effect size, compared to the method effect, indicates that dimensionality has a more substantial impact on performance than the choice of method. Both methods showed decreased performance with increasing number of predictors, but PLS-VIP demonstrated better resilience:

\begin{itemize}
    \item PLS-VIP: $J$=7 (M=0.327), $J$=11 (M=0.254), $J$=20 (M=0.166)
    \item RWA: $J$=7 (M=0.233), $J$=11 (M=0.189), $J$=20 (M=0.128)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Correlation Structure Effects}
Correlation structure significantly impacted performance (F = 16.10, p < 0.001, $\eta^2$ = 0.0003), with RWA showing greater sensitivity to higher correlations. Figure~\ref{fig:correlation_effect} demonstrates how the performance of both methods varies across different correlation structures, with PLS-VIP maintaining more stable performance:

\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
    \item PLS-VIP: maintained relatively stable performance across correlation levels
    \item RWA: showed marked performance degradation at higher correlations
    \item Significant method Ã— correlation interaction (F = 13.01, p < 0.001, $\eta^2$ = 0.0003)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Type Impact}
Data type (continuous vs. ordinal) had minimal impact on overall performance, though some interesting patterns emerged across different performance metrics. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:performance_comparison}, both methods maintained consistent performance patterns across data types, with PLS showing slightly better performance across all metrics.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Sample Size and Other Effects}
Several secondary factors showed notable effects:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sample size: surprisingly minimal impact (F = 0.32, p = 0.72), suggesting both methods perform consistently across different sample sizes
    \item Effect magnitude: small but significant effect (F = 3.03, p < 0.05), with stronger effects being easier to detect
    \item Noise levels: small but significant effect (F = 3.15, p < 0.05), with performance degrading at higher noise levels
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Interaction Effects}
Significant interactions were observed between method and other factors, as visualized in Figure~\ref{fig:interaction_effects}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Number of predictors (F = 37.89, p < 0.001, $\eta^2$ = 0.0008)
    \item Correlation structure (F = 13.01, p < 0.001, $\eta^2$ = 0.0003)
\end{itemize}

    \label{fig:interaction_effects}
\end{figure}

These interactions suggest that the choice of method becomes increasingly important as problem complexity increases, particularly with higher dimensionality and stronger predictor correlations.
